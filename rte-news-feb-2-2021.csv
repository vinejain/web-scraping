We started looking at the struggles that the age group of 18-22 go through and I'm delighted we had that conversation."

My management style in the GAA has changed a lot in the last few years. I focus on understanding the individuals - their mannerisms and what makes them tick. When you have a group of people, you can't treat them all the same way because they're not the same. I have to figure out what will motivate each person and how to get the best out of them. Bringing that [perspective], as well as bringing people in to help me, would give these guys a step up. I have to make it clear though: You can do everything but it's up to the guys. If they don't want to take that step, it's not going to happen."

It was tough. These guys have probably been let down with different things and they find it hard to trust people so you had to build that trust up. It was very challenging to get the guys to buy in but it was very rewarding once they did."

Believe it or not, and a lot of people would find this hard to believe, but I'm very soft at heart. When I heard some of their stories, I'll be honest, it got to me. Seeing where they were at times and the troubles they were going through... it really got to me. I so just wanted to fix it and make it better but I wasn't capable of that. I can't just do that, they have to want to do it. This was a way for them to get a small bit of help and, hopefully, they can build on that and things will get easier."

We did all sorts of challenges - physical and mental - and what that does is tell you someone's behavioural pattern. Do they trust someone else? How do they react under pressure?

And the studies keep on coming. A recent one found that swearing can be an effective coping strategy for dealing with road rage.

After swearing, drivers reported feeling more positive, suggesting that swearing can ease road rage. And surely it is better to swear in the car for a few minutes than to get to your destination and behave badly towards the people around you? There are many reasons why swearing – a cheap, readily available, calorie-neutral, drug-free means of self-help – is number one on this list."

It's a popular belief in the busy and goal-oriented times we live in, which can make us look down on people who are bored as lazy or unimaginative. But is that the case? Amazingly, boredom is a universal human experience – everyone finds themselves bored from time to time. Psychologists say it is simply a feeling of having no intention or purpose – an unsuccessful desire to engage in the world. It's rather like being in limbo."

One answer is that boredom compels us to try and establish meaning, which can trigger creativity. One study has shown that deliberately making people bored by watching dull videos (for example someone hanging out laundry) produces measurably improved performance of subsequent creativity tasks. So, actually, boredom may be a state to be embraced as a condition of possibility and opportunity."

It can often be unclear whether you are even asking the right questions, let alone finding the right answers.

"St. Brigid's powerful cultural heritage","","https://www.rte.ie/gaeilge/2021/0129/1193929-st-brigids-powerful-cultural-heritage/","In Irish folk tradition, the calendar is principally split into 'Quarter Days', so called as they divide the year into each of its four seasons of summer (May Day / Bealtaine), autumn (Lammas / Lúnasa), winter (Halloween / Samhain) and, of course, spring (St. Brigid’s Day / Imbolc), which falls on the 1st of February. Jonny Dillon, folklorist, tells us of her cultural significance."
"St. Brigid's powerful cultural heritage","","https://www.rte.ie/gaeilge/2021/0129/1193929-st-brigids-powerful-cultural-heritage/","St. Brigid’s Day is dedicated to the saint nicknamed Muire na nGael or the ‘Mary of the Irish’, a designation given to her on account of the adoration and high regard in which she has long been held by the people of this island. The special position attributed to her is reflected even in the name Brigid, which means ‘high’, ‘lofty’, ‘elevated’, or ‘exalted’ one."
"St. Brigid's powerful cultural heritage","","https://www.rte.ie/gaeilge/2021/0129/1193929-st-brigids-powerful-cultural-heritage/","To come to a full understanding and appreciation of her feast however, we must examine the Pre-Christian roots, not just of the celebration, but of the figure of Brigid herself."
"St. Brigid's powerful cultural heritage","","https://www.rte.ie/gaeilge/2021/0129/1193929-st-brigids-powerful-cultural-heritage/","Prior to any veneration of the early Christian saint, the 1st of February was the day on which the festival of Imbolc was held in Ireland; a festival which, in welcoming the arrival of spring, had as its focus fertility and propagation. The word Imbolc literally means ‘in the womb’, though it also appears in early literature as Oímelc meaning ‘lactation’; both words however, attest to a consideration at this time of birth, renewal and the feminine."
"St. Brigid's powerful cultural heritage","","https://www.rte.ie/gaeilge/2021/0129/1193929-st-brigids-powerful-cultural-heritage/","Attached to the celebration of Imbolc was the Pre-Christian deity Brighid, patroness of poets, smith workers and livestock, goddess of healing and daughter of the Daghda (who himself was father-god of the Tuatha Dé Danann; the mythical race said to inhabit Ireland before the arrival of humans)."
"St. Brigid's powerful cultural heritage","","https://www.rte.ie/gaeilge/2021/0129/1193929-st-brigids-powerful-cultural-heritage/","The festival of Imbolc, dedicated as it is to the goddess Brighid and falling as it does on the 1st of February, would seem later to have become heavily associated with the woman who, born in Co. Louth around 455 AD, Christianised her tribe, took the name of Brigid, and went on to establish what is likely Ireland’s oldest monastery at Kildare (a demonstration of the central role of women at the earliest phase of the Christian church in Ireland)."
"St. Brigid's powerful cultural heritage","","https://www.rte.ie/gaeilge/2021/0129/1193929-st-brigids-powerful-cultural-heritage/","The most widely known custom connected with St. Brigid’s Day involves the construction of rushwork crosses. These crosses are most likely Pre-Christian in origin and appear in a variety of types; most familiar perhaps is the four-armed, swastika type cross, although there are also three armed crosses and elaborate lozenge type crosses found in other portions of the country."
"St. Brigid's powerful cultural heritage","","https://www.rte.ie/gaeilge/2021/0129/1193929-st-brigids-powerful-cultural-heritage/","These crosses, hung in the rafters of the house, were employed to garner the blessing of the saint and to protect the home against fire. The cross making tradition was quite weak in Leinster, and would seem to have been almost entirely unknown in Co. Wicklow (although there is small evidence for the construction of crosses in the area around Lough Dan in the centre of the county)."
"St. Brigid's powerful cultural heritage","","https://www.rte.ie/gaeilge/2021/0129/1193929-st-brigids-powerful-cultural-heritage/","More widely observed across Ireland, was the practice of dressing up the dash of a churn (a once common household item used by our forebears in the production of butter) as an effigy of the saint. This effigy was called the Brídeog."
"St. Brigid's powerful cultural heritage","","https://www.rte.ie/gaeilge/2021/0129/1193929-st-brigids-powerful-cultural-heritage/","The Brídeog having been constructed, a band of young men would travel the locality from house to house masked in ‘vizards’ so as to be rendered anonymous, and, wearing ‘strange clothes’ and women’s garments, this motley assortment (known as ‘Biddy Boys’) would play mouth organs, melodeons, and concertinas in each of the houses they visited."
"St. Brigid's powerful cultural heritage","","https://www.rte.ie/gaeilge/2021/0129/1193929-st-brigids-powerful-cultural-heritage/","Upon entering the house the Biddy Boys would begin their music, singing and dancing, and the leader of the procession, brandishing the effigy of the saint, would entreat the occupants therein to hand over a few pence in order that St. Brigid might bless and protect them in the year ahead. The money gathered by the Biddy Boys was thereafter used in organising a dance in the locality (or, as was described in one instance, put to good use in an altogether more private capacity at a local public house!)"
"St. Brigid's powerful cultural heritage","","https://www.rte.ie/gaeilge/2021/0129/1193929-st-brigids-powerful-cultural-heritage/","St. Brigid herself was said to travel across Ireland on the eve of her feast, and items were often left outside the house overnight so as to procure her blessing. In the land around Lower Calary in north east Wicklow, a dish of salt was kept outside on the eve of the 1st of February, this was then used to cure sore throats. In other parts of the country a ribbon or piece of fabric was left out overnight. This was known as ‘Brigid’s Mantle’, and was used to ensure fertility in women and assist them in childbirth."
"St. Brigid's powerful cultural heritage","","https://www.rte.ie/gaeilge/2021/0129/1193929-st-brigids-powerful-cultural-heritage/","St. Brigid’s curative powers are further recognisable in lore regarding holy wells in Wicklow that bear her name. Lower Calary in north east Wicklow has two holy wells dedicated to St. Brigid, the water from one of which was renowned to have a cure for vomiting. In Rathdangan in west Wicklow individuals with warts would visit their local St. Brigid’s well nine days in succession, bathing the affected area in order to rid themselves of their ailment. Similar practices were carried out at St. Brigid’s well in Kilranelagh, in west Wicklow, and small items and relics were left at this well in honour of the saint; a ribbon or a ‘holy picture’, we are told."
"St. Brigid's powerful cultural heritage","","https://www.rte.ie/gaeilge/2021/0129/1193929-st-brigids-powerful-cultural-heritage/","Symbols of fertility, rebirth and femininity resonate through Brigid, and with spring come the gifts of propagation, renewal and growth. There is a promise in the air: soil is yet to be tilled and our young yet to be born, but the harsh rigours of winter are passing away."
