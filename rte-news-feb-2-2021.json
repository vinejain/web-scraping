Any defence force needs capabilities for future contingencies and the ability to evolve in facing what may well be extreme events requiring a fuller spectrum of force to be employed. Moroever, in per capita income terms, Ireland is at least as well off as Finland, New Zealand or Austria and yet Ireland’s military balance sheet appears much more limited than those countries.

     "section": "Ever heard that only boring people get bored? It's a popular belief in the busy and goal-oriented times we live in, which can make us look down on people who are bored as lazy or unimaginative. But is that the case? Amazingly, boredom is a universal human experience – everyone finds themselves bored from time to time. Psychologists say it is simply a feeling of having no intention or purpose – an unsuccessful desire to engage in the world. It's rather like being in limbo."

One study has shown that deliberately making people bored by watching dull videos (for example someone hanging out laundry) produces measurably improved performance of subsequent creativity tasks. So, actually, boredom may be a state to be embraced as a condition of possibility and opportunity."

It can often be unclear whether you are even asking the right questions, let alone finding the right answers.

In other parts of the country a ribbon or piece of fabric was left out overnight. This was known as ‘Brigid’s Mantle’, and was used to ensure fertility in women and assist them in childbirth."

In Rathdangan in west Wicklow individuals with warts would visit their local St. Brigid’s well nine days in succession, bathing the affected area in order to rid themselves of their ailment. Similar practices were carried out at St. Brigid’s well in Kilranelagh, in west Wicklow, and small items and relics were left at this well in honour of the saint; a ribbon or a ‘holy picture’, we are told."
